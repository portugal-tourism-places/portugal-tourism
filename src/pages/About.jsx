            <p>We are a group of passionate Web Development students at Ironhack, united by our curiosity, creativity, and drive to build impactful digital experiences. During our time at Ironhack, we've learned to code, collaborate, and bring ideas to life using modern technologies like React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

                This project is the result of our dedication, teamwork, and the desire to apply everything we've learned in a real-world context. Our goal is to not just create functional web apps, but also to design user-friendly and engaging experiences that reflect our journey and growth as developers.

                Thank you for visiting our app â€” we hope you enjoy exploring it as much as we enjoyed building it!</p>
